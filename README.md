# OLD-Project
Throughout my journey of learning to code, each project I undertook was a stepping stone towards my ultimate goal of becoming a proficient programmer. Starting with the low-level Assembly language, I slowly built up my knowledge and skills by learning higher-level languages like C, C++, and MATLAB. As I delved deeper into the world of programming, I discovered the power of Python and the vast array of applications it offers.

In my pursuit of knowledge, I also learned web development languages such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, which allowed me to create interactive and engaging websites. Through each project, I encountered challenges that tested my problem-solving skills and helped me grow as a programmer.

As I continue to learn and expand my skill set, I look forward to tackling new and exciting projects that challenge me to push my limits as a programmer.
